# Browser testing checklist

Start the Next.js app using `npm run dev` from **Terminal → New Terminal** in VS Code. To test in VS Code's integrated browser, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), run **Simple Browser: Show**, and enter `http://localhost:3000`; alternatively, open the URL in a regular browser. Test at a mobile viewport around 375 px wide as well as a desktop-size viewport.

- On a clean browser profile, confirm three sample tasks appear with varied priorities, due dates, and one completed task.
- Add a high-, medium-, or low-priority task, with and without a due date. Blank task names should not be accepted.
- Edit a task's name, priority, and due date; confirm the updated values remain after refresh.
- Toggle completion and confirm the progress percentage, counters, and completed styling update.
- Delete a task and confirm it stays deleted after refresh.
- Try All, Active, and Completed filters from both the task filter row and sidebar navigation.
- Switch among Light, Dark, Neon, and Glass, then refresh to confirm the selected theme persists.
- Use a dated task's calendar icon to open a prefilled Google Calendar event. Export `.ics` and confirm a calendar file downloads.
- Open **Sign in**, switch to **Create account**, and submit; the app must clearly say authentication is not configured and that no credentials were sent.
- Select Google Calendar, Calendly, and Microsoft Calendar; each should state that setup is required and no connection was made.
- Enter `<script>alert(1)</script>` as a task and confirm it is rendered as text.
- Use keyboard navigation to operate controls and dialogs; confirm Escape, the close button, and clicking outside a dialog close it.
- Clear the browser's site data and refresh to confirm the three first-run sample tasks return.

## Automated checks

```powershell
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Authentication and connected calendar sync are intentionally not testable until a backend and provider OAuth configuration are implemented.
